## 🧭 About This Repository

This is more than a class code archive — it is a **ready-to-use Python curriculum** for anyone who wants to **learn Python from scratch** or **teach Python** to beginners.

The course is taught using both `.py` scripts and **Jupyter Notebooks**, giving students an interactive, hands-on learning experience. Topics are introduced progressively, building confidence week by week — from your very first `print()` statement all the way to functions and problem-solving with mini projects.

Each week contains:

- 💻 **Lab source code** — clean `.py` files and Jupyter Notebooks written during sessions
- 📝 **Assignments** — real tasks assigned to students to practice independently
- 🧪 **Quizzes** — exercises used to reinforce and test weekly understanding
- 🎬 **Recorded lectures** — the full YouTube playlist linked above
- 📄 **Final project** — a capstone challenge to apply everything learned

Whether you're a student, a self-learner, or an educator — everything is here and ready to use.

## 📚 Full Curriculum — Week by Week

### 🟡 Week 1 — Python Basics
Your very first steps in Python. Understand how Python works, write your first program, and get comfortable with the language's simple, readable syntax.

**Topics:** Python syntax & structure, `print()` function, strings and string formatting, variables, basic data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`), comments

---

### 🟡 Week 2 — Input, Output & Operators
Make your programs interactive and learn how to perform calculations and manipulate data.

**Topics:** `input()` for user input, type conversion (`int()`, `float()`, `str()`), arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`), assignment operators, operator precedence, formatted output with `f-strings`

---

### 🟡 Week 4 — Conditions & Decision Making
Teach your program to think and respond differently based on different situations.

**Topics:** `if`, `elif`, `else` statements, nested conditions, comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`), logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`), practical condition examples

---

### 🟡 Week 5 — Loops & Repetition
One of the most powerful tools in programming — repeating actions automatically.

**Topics:** `for` loop, `while` loop, `range()` function, `break` and `continue` statements, nested loops, loop patterns and exercises

---

### 🟡 Week 6 — Lists & Tuples
Store and work with collections of data in an organized way.

**Topics:** Creating and indexing lists, list methods (`append()`, `remove()`, `sort()`, `len()`, etc.), list slicing, iterating lists with loops, tuples vs lists, immutability, unpacking

---

### 🟡 Week 9 — Dictionaries
Work with structured, real-world data using key-value pairs.

**Topics:** Creating and accessing dictionaries, adding, updating, and removing entries, dictionary methods (`keys()`, `values()`, `items()`), iterating over dictionaries, nested dictionaries, practical examples

---

### 🟡 Week 10 — Functions
Write reusable, organized, and clean code by grouping logic into functions.

**Topics:** Defining and calling functions with `def`, parameters and arguments, return values, default parameters, scope (local vs global variables), calling functions within functions, building small utilities

---

### 🟡 Week 11 — Mini Projects & Problem Solving
Put it all together. Apply everything learned to build small but complete programs that solve real problems.

**Topics:** Combining data types, conditions, loops, and functions; structured problem decomposition; building small practical projects; debugging and testing logic

---

## 🎓 For Learners & Educators

### 👨‍🎓 If you're learning Python:
Follow the weeks in order. Before each session, watch the YouTube lecture for that week. Then open the folder, run the code, read through it, and complete the assignment and quiz. Python is one of the most beginner-friendly languages — if you go week by week without skipping, you'll be writing real programs by Week 11.

### 👩‍🏫 If you're teaching Python:
This is a complete, structured curriculum ready to use in the classroom. All lab code is written in both `.py` files and interactive Jupyter Notebooks — perfect for live coding sessions. Assignments and quizzes are included for each topic, and a final project ties everything together. Adapt it freely with attribution.

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.x installed. For Jupyter Notebooks, install Jupyter or use VS Code with the Jupyter extension.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aya-alharazin/IUG-Programming-1-Lab-WDMM-1003.git

# 2. Navigate to a weekly folder
cd week01

# 3. Run a Python file
python hello.py

# 4. Or open a Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook week01.ipynb
```

> 💡 Recommended tools: **VS Code** with Python + Jupyter extensions, or **PyCharm Community Edition** for `.py` files. For notebooks, **JupyterLab** or **Google Colab** (no installation needed) are great options.

### Recommended Learning Path
1. Watch the YouTube lecture for the week 🎬
2. Open the folder — read the `.py` files or launch the notebook 📂
3. Run the code, change things, see what happens 💻
4. Complete the assignment and quiz 📝
5. Move on to the next week ➡️

## 📄 Final Project

The final project specification is in [`Final Project - Python.pdf`](./Final%20Project%20-%20Python.pdf). It is a capstone challenge that brings together variables, conditions, loops, data structures, and functions. Read it early — start thinking about your approach before the deadline.
