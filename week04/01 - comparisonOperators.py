Comparison operators (or Relational operators) in Python
allow you to compare two values and return a Boolean result: either True or False
These operators are fundamental building blocks for creating conditional logic
and decision-making in your programs.

The Six Comparison Operators
Operator         Name                      Example     Result
==               Equal to                  5 == 5       True
!=               Not equal to              5 != 3       True
<                Less than                 3 < 5        True
>                Greater than              5 > 3        True
<=               Less than or equal to     5 <= 5       True
>=               Greater than or equal to  5 >= 3       True
-- Chained Comparisons :
x = 5
print(1 < x < 10)
'''
num1 =5
num2 =10
num3=5
print(num1 == num2)
print(num1 > num2)
print(num1 >= num3)
print(1<num1<10) # True
